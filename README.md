Health Vector Services

@tedder42 and @tmarthal 

An analysis application to apply simple vector field propagation to point pollution sources to determine 
near-real time accessible health information.


Data Information

Sources 
- Pollution Sources
  - Factories (also get Mexican factory locations)
  - Fires (temporal)
  - Traffic (temporal, e.g. Waze API)
  - Airports

Future Ideas:
- Pollen emitters
- Fortune Cookie Smells
- Mexican factory locations

Transforms:
- Pollution Propagation
-- Wind
--** Future, use ocean vector propagation/rivers/etc (water, ocean), sewer overflow


Vulnerable Points
- Pollution Targets
-- Schools
-- High Children Density (e.g. Daycare, neighborhoods, etc).
-- Elderly (ElderCare, hospitals, etc.)
-- Parks
-- Beaches 
--** Mobile Apps (temporal point)
 
 
Questions?
Health inequality between neighborhoods (do higher income families get to live in healthier air conditions?)

City Planning Purposes? Could a planner use a drag+drop interface to place a factory somewhere to see
how historic wind propagation affects location of commercial developments.
Same with residential zoning regulations - 

 
Where should we go to avoid the Pollution?
