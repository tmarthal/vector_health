Lessons Learned

>> This is a hard problem because the data is messed up.

Better front end than a perfect back-end. 
Hardcode some data based on pattern recognition
No time for the analytics and math, if it doesn't look good. 

Regroup:

Show things on a map, however plume modeling is tough.
Wasn't feasible with the time-frame. 


Intro: 
Weather service measures ozone, but doesn't do actual pollution propagation.

Sensor data is too sparse (wide) to cover LA. We use true wind direction from time of day.year and use true plume direction
to calculate impact. 

Can overlay vulnerable things
can get pollution sources with basic pollution strengths


Pollution Sources
-- Bubble for size of pollution (how to show severity)


Community Targets 
-- 



Underestimated the amount of work, Team Size was too Small
Also had too little GIS experience


Government Data is hard to parse
