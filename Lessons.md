Lessons Learned


Regroup:

Show things on a map, however plume modeling is tough.
Wasn't feasible with the time-frame. 


Intro: 
Weather service measures ozone, but doesn't do actual pollution propagation.

Sensor data is too sparse (wide) to cover LA. We use true wind direction from time of day.year and use true plume direction
to calculate impact. 

Can overlay vulnerable things
can get pollution sources with basic pollution strengths


Pollution Sources
-- Bubble for size of pollution (how to show severity)


Community Targets 
-- 

Can we


Underestimated the amount of work, Team Size was too Small
Also had too little GIS experience


Government Data is hard to parse
