Plan for chemical weapon attacks against large cities.

Empirical model - data from actual wind velocity -- hardest part
no solving of Navier Stokes equations (they run the equation solver)_

Runge Kutta - favorite ODE solver

Build historical model, June 1st, 2011 - can assume 
Do not take into account intensity, heat equation, the ODE becomes a PDE. Hyperbolic driving flow. 

Baseline dataset - where is the pollution today

Questions we want to ask: 

Planning

Sources, wind velocity, are there pollution sensors that we can scrape as well? 
Particulates, air quality sensor
Ozone is just one feature, in one dimensionality of pollution

Sources of pollution, how do we enumerate those? 
Power plants, cars/highways, etc. 

Any model that we do, ground in realty? of course, we can 

Need to verify to actual sensor data; delta - see what the difference are? secondary and tertarty data sources (not windy, super windy, etc.) may still believe the model. 
Noise in models, because we are taking first order differences and interpolating



How are we going to say that we believe the model? we believe the underlying physics


What is the existing planning of pollution?
can we correlate the pollution to attendance rate,
need to find pollution pattern, time series

can we see attendance rates historically, map those against the pollution rate. 
Then if there is a fire in malibu we can predict the school attendance

Equations of motions for different types of particles, estimation of mass varies the propagation parameters (cross-section of particles, etc.) 

-- People have studied pollution in the past. UCLA school of public policy, see what types of models are generated. And just use those. 


Univariate sensors, need generative model for every type of pollution. EngageLA type of project. Here is the hypothesis == 
rents are lower in residential areas more susceptable to pollution
Look for historic pollution data, can use that as the initial condition ;; back calculate 

Do you believe the surf report based on the buoys in Santa Monica Bay? Do not take into account local variances.
